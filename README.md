# 4-bit-multiplier-using-array-and-Add-Shift-in-Verilog
### Description of the first part:  
In this project, we first design a 4-bit full adder. Then, we design an array multiplier for four-bit numbers using this full adder.
### Description of the second part:
In this part, we design a multiplier using Add & Shift for unsigned four-bit numbers.
### Description of the third part:
#### In the Add & Shift multiplier of the previous part, we apply the following changes in order:
1. By combining the addition and shift operations, we make the multiplication operation always possible in 4 pulses.
2. We design Add & Shift multiplier for signed numbers.
